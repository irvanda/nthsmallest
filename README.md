# nthsmallest
Find the nth smallest number:  Given input: ([] array, n)  output: nth smallest number of array  ex: array[]={3,2,5,7} output(array[],3)=5   Common Running Time There are some common running times when analyzing an algorithm:  O(1) - Constant Time Constant time means the running time is constant, itâ€™s not affected by the input size.  O(n) - Linear Time When an algorithm accepts n input size, it would perform n operations as well.  O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Algorithm that has running time O(log n) is slight faster than O(n). Commonly, algorithm divides the problem into sub problems with the same size. Example: binary search algorithm, binary conversion algorithm.  O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time This running time is often found in "divide &amp; conquer algorithms" which divide the problem into sub problems recursively and then merge them in n time. Example: Merge Sort algorithm.  O(n2) - Quadratic Time Look Bubble Sort algorithm!  O(n3) - Cubic Time It has the same principle with O(n2).  O(2n) - Exponential Time It is very slow as input get larger, if n = 1000.000, T(n) would be 21000.000. Brute Force algorithm has this running time.  O(n!) - Factorial Time THE SLOWEST !!! Example : Travel Salesman Problem (TSP)
